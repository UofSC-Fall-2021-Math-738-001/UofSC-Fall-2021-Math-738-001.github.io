Assume that $F$ is flat. And take $P \doubleheadedarrow M$ with $M$ projective. Then, 
we have a short exact sequence 
$$
    0 \to \operatorname{Tor}_1^R(F,M) \to F \otimes_R K \to F \otimes P \to F \otimes M \to 0
$$
Since $F$ is flat, we know that 
$$
    0 \to F \otimes_R K \to F \otimes P \to F \otimes M \to 0
$$
is exact also. Thus $\operatorname{Tor}_1^R(F,M) = 0$. We also have 
$$
    \operatorname{Tor}_2^R(F,M) \cong \operatorname{Tor}_1^R(F,K)  
$$
As we have $\operatorname{Tor}_1$ vanishing for any $M$, we get $\operatorname{Tor}_2^R(F,M) = 0$
for any $M$ also. Moving up the chain we get $\operatorname{Tor}_i^R(F,-) = 0$.

If $\operatarname{Tor}_i^R(F,-) = 0$ for $i > 0$, then certainly $\operatorname{Tor}_1^R(F,-) = 0$. 

Assume that $\operatorname{Tor}_1^R(F,-) = 0$. Take any exact sequence 
$$
    0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0
$$
and we get an exact sequence 
$$
\cdots \to $\operatorname{Tor}_1^R(F,C) \to F \otimes_R C \to F \otimes_R B \to F \otimes_A \to 0
$$
Since $$\operatorname{Tor}_1^R(F,C) = 0$, we have that 
$$
     0 \to F \otimes_R C \to F \otimes_R B \to F \otimes_A \to 0 
$$
is exact.
