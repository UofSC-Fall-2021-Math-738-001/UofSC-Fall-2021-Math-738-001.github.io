    "content": ". | Calling back to linear algebra, we can take $R = k$ a field and $M = k^n$ with scalar multiplication. | More important for our course is the following. Let $f : R \\to S$ be a homomorphism of rings and let $N$ be an $S$-module. Then we can equip the underlying abelian group $N$ with an $R$-module structure by declaring \\(r \\cdot n := f(r) n.\\) The resulting $R$-module will be denoted by $f_\\ast N$ and is called the pushforward of $N$. (The language will be clearer when we get to some geometry.) . | As an example of pushforward, consider the inclusion $i: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ and the $\\mathbb{R}$-vector space $i_\\ast \\mathbb{C}$. We have $i_\\ast \\mathbb{C} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$ since $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mathbb{C} = 2$. | Any ideal $I \\leq R$ is an $R$-module as is any quotient $R/I$. | . Let us look at the set $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(R,R)$. We have an evaluation map \\(ev_1 : \\operatorname{Hom}_R(R,R) \\to R \\\\ f \\mapsto f(1).\\) The value at $1$ complemently determines $f$ since \\(f(r) = f(r \\cdot 1) = r f(1).\\) We see that $f$ is given by right multiplication by $f(1)$. Since left multiplication and right multiplication commute, there is an inverse map \\(R \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(R,R) \\\\ r \\mapsto (r^\\prime \\mapsto r^\\prime r).\\) . In general, left multiplication is not an $R$-module homomorphism. For the function \\(m_r (r^\\prime) = r r^\\prime\\) saying that $m_r (r^\\prime) = r^\\prime m_r(1)$ is just saying that \\(r^\\prime r = r r^\\prime\\) which is only true for all $r^\\prime$ if $r \\in Z(R)$ the center of $R$.

    "title": "Modules over the path algebra",
    "content": "We look at an extended example now. Let $Q$ be a finite direct graph, also known as a quiver. Let $R$ be a commutative ring. Then the path algebra $RQ$ is the free $R$-module on the set of paths in $Q$ with multiplication given by path concatenation. For a particularly simple example, consider the following quiver . and use $Q$ to denote it also. Then we have four paths. The two arrows we will denote as $a$ and $b$ plus the length $0$ loops at the two nodes, $e_0$ and $e_1$. Thus \\(RQ = Re_0 \\oplus Ra \\oplus Rb \\oplus Re_1\\) and the nonzero products are \\(ae_0 = a = e_1a \\ , \\ be_0 = b = e_1b \\ , \\ e_0^2 = e_0 \\ , \\ e_1^2 = e_1.\\) . Let $M$ be a $RQ$-module. Let us repackage the information present in the $RQ$-module structure in terms of more familiar data. Note that \\(1 = e_0 + e_1\\) in $RQ$. So we can write \\(M = e_0 M \\oplus e_1 M.\\) For shorthand, set $M_i = e_i M$. Each $M_i$ is only an $R$-module. For each arrow $a$ in $Q$, action by $a$ gives a map \\(\\phi_a : M_{h(a)} \\to M_{t(a)}\\) which is $R$-linear. So we have an assignment \\(M \\mapsto \\lbrace M_i, \\phi_a : M_{h(a)} \\to M_{t(a)} \\mid i \\in Q_0, a \\in Q_1 \\rbrace\\) This process is reversible. Given $(M_i, \\phi_a)$, we set \\(M = \\bigoplus_i M_i\\) and let $a$ act by $\\phi_a$ on $M$. Given a morphism $f : M \\to M^\\prime$ of $RQ$-modules, since $f(e_i M) = e_i f(M)$ we see we have induced maps $f_i : M_i \\to M_i^\\prime$. Since $f(am) = af(m)$, we see that \\(f_i \\circ \\phi_a = \\phi_a \\circ f_i\\) for any arrow $a$. This process is also reversible. Thus the data of $RQ$-modules and their morphisms is the same as collections of $R$-modules indexed by vertices with $R$-linear maps indexed by arrows of $Q$. This is the first example of an equivalence of categories. ",

Two things have to occur: Isolation: Students who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are released from isolation when a medical professional has determined, based on the current CDC and DHEC guidelines, that they have recovered. Currently, these guidelines include being fever-free for at least 24 hours and at least 10 days from their first symptom or positive test if they are asymptomatic. Quarantine: Unvaccinated students who are deemed a close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case will be quarantined for 7-14 days from their last contact with the infected individual. More specifically, students who test negative on day 5, 6, or 7 can leave quarantine after 7 full days; individuals who did not test but remain asymptomatic can leave after 10 full days. Individuals who are symptomatic or have other health concerns may be advised to remain under quarantine for 14 days.  . What is the attendance policy if I get COVID? In brief, I must provide make-up course work including content and assignments when students have excused absences which include (but are not limited to) being in quarantine or isolation, religious holidays, medical conditions related to pregnancy, and military duty. However, recorded classes and hybrid/online options are not required and should not be expected. All excused absences must have documentation. See syllabus for further attendance policies. How will the Dr. Ballard know if I am absent due to quarantine or isolation? COVID-19 related absences must be document through the Student Ombudsman.  Students who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or have been exposed and require quarantining should complete the COVID-19 Student Report Form and instructors should request this form in order to excuse the absence.  . Can I inquire about classmates condition with COVID? Sadly, not with me. These are health issues and the information is protected by state and federal law. If an individual student has questions about whether they should quarantine or believe that they have been in close contact, have them reach out to the COVID Phone Bank (803-576-8511). Would we ever change to go online if too many people are sick? Only in the rare instance that 30% or more of students have documented excused absences may I take the course online. This is not to be expected and very complicated according to the current policies. What if Dr. Ballard gets sick with COVID? I have been fully vaccinated and breakthrough infection symptoms most often resemble the common cold. In the event of a breakthrough infection, I will enter the self-isolation period and the course will switch modality to synchronous online temporarily. In the rare circumstance I am unable to teach remotely, a substitute instructor will take over the course. ",

Because the university classroom is a place designed for the free exchange of ideas, we must show respect for one another in all circumstances. We will show respect for one another by exhibiting patience and courtesy in our exchanges. Appropriate language and restraint from verbal attacks upon those whose perspectives differ from your own is a minimum requirement. Courtesy and kindness is the norm for those who participate in the class. Mistakes, in particular during the running phase, are expected and natural. Mistakes are how learning happens. All students should recognize and respect the bravery of a student presenting a proof or solution. If you ever feel uncomfortable beyond the intellectual challenge of the course, please contact me. Teams is a way for you to share your ideas and learning with your colleagues in this class. We do this as colleagues in learning, and the online space is meant to be a safe and respectful environment for us to conduct these discussions. Some general netiquette rules: . | Treat one another with respect. It will be expected that we will not attack one another personally for holding different opinions. | Do not use all CAPITAL LETTERS in emails or discussion board postings. This is considered “shouting” and is seen as impolite or aggressive. | Begin emails with a proper salutation (Examples: Dr. Name; Ms. Name; Hello Professor Name; Good afternoon Mr. Name). Starting an email without a salutation or a simple “Hey” is not appropriate. | When sending an email, please include a detailed subject line. Additionally, make sure you reference the course number (Ex. ENGL 287) in the message and sign the mail with your name. | Use proper grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Text messaging language is not acceptable. | Use good taste when communicating. Profanity should be avoided. | Re-Read, think, and edit your message before you click “Send/Submit/Post.” . | Please remember when posting to be respectful and courteous to your colleagues, and limit your communication to topics of this course and the assignments. | .

Each day is a small step forward. When we turn around at the end of the course, only then, do we see how far we have truly traveled. For more of my pedagogical philosophy and experience, take a look at the teaching page. As an extension of teaching, I take pride in mentoring researchers at any stage. For a brief introduction to my mentees see the mentoring page. In my research, I study algebraic geometry and am particularly interested in questions arising from Homological Mirror Symmetry. Much of my current work focuses on derived categories and their relation to more classical questions. My research has been partially supported by the Simons Foundation and the National Science Foundation. It has also benefited from a membership at the Institute for Advanced Study, funding from UofSC, and the Southeastern Conference. For more information about me, see my CV.
