It will be expected that we will not attack one another personally for holding different opinions. | Do not use all CAPITAL LETTERS in emails or discussion board postings. This is considered “shouting” and is seen as impolite or aggressive. | Begin emails with a proper salutation (Examples: Dr. Name; Ms. Name; Hello Professor Name; Good afternoon Mr. Name).

Additionally, make sure you reference the course number (Ex. ENGL 287) in the message and sign the mail with your name. | Use proper grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Text messaging language is not acceptable. | Use good taste when communicating.

    "content": "Matthew Ballard . ballard@math.sc.edu . Schedule an appointment . I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of South Carolina. I have been teaching mathematics for almost two decades and have guided nearly 1000 students from all levels through math courses. A mindset focused on growth is essential for learning mathematics. Each day is a small step forward. When we turn around at the end of the course, only then, do we see how far we have truly traveled. For more of my pedagogical philosophy and experience, take a look at the teaching page. As an extension of teaching, I take pride in mentoring researchers at any stage. For a brief introduction to my mentees see the mentoring page. In my research, I study algebraic geometry and am particularly interested in questions arising from Homological Mirror Symmetry. Much of my current work focuses on derived categories and their relation to more classical questions. My research has been partially supported by the Simons Foundation and the National Science Foundation. It has also benefited from a membership at the Institute for Advanced Study, funding from UofSC, and the Southeastern Conference. For more information about me, see my CV. For a research summary and a list of my papers, take a look at my research page. I regularly organize mathematical events, even virtual ones. For the full list of events, see the organizing page. If you are interested in participating, contact me. ",
