    "title": "A motivating example",
    "content": "Linear algebra is ubiquitous. It can even appear seemingly out of no-where. For example, assume we have two races of aliens. They are at constant war. To understand the progress of the war, we want to know the population of each at any given time. Let us try to mathematize this. First, we need to assign some labels. Let’s call the population of the first group $X$ and the population of the second $Y$. These are functions of time, which we call $t$. So we can also write $X(t)$ and $Y(t)$ to emphasize this. Now the populations grow as they procreate. The populations decrease with repeated conflicts. Let’s make this more precise. | Say it takes 4 aliens to produce 1 more of $X$ and 3 aliens to make 1 more of $Y$ and | 2 aliens of type $X$ eliminates 1 of $Y$ while 3 aliens of $Y$ remove 1 of $X$. | . Then we can model the populations with the system of differential equations: . \\[X^\\prime(t) = \\frac{1}{4} X(t) - \\frac{1}{3} Y(t) \\\\ {} \\\\ Y^\\prime(t) = - \\frac{1}{2} X(t) + \\frac{1}{3} Y(t).\\] This seems complicated. Let’s try to understand a basic problem: is possible for the populations $X$ and $Y$ to be constant? In other words, is there a steady-state solution? . If the populations are constant, then we have \\(X^\\prime(t) = Y^\\prime(t) = 0\\) and there are fixed constant values $x$ and $y$ so that \\(X(t) = x \\text{ and } Y(t) = y\\) for any value of time $t$. So, we need to solve \\(0 = \\frac{1}{4} x - \\frac{1}{3} y \\\\ {} \\\\ 0 = - \\frac{1}{2} x + \\frac{1}{3} y\\) for the possible $x$ and $y$. Can we? . The collection of equations is a called a system of linear equations. Our first goal is to understand when it is possible to find solutions and how we can do so explicitly. ",

    "title": "Linear equations",
    "content": "A linear equation in a set of variables $x_1,x_2,x_3,\\ldots,x_m$ is a equation of the form \\(a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \\cdots + a_m x_m = b\\) for constant numbers $a_1,\\ldots,a_m, b$. So, for example, \\(-x_1 + 2x_2 - 3x_3 + 4x_4 = 5\\) would be a linear equation in 4 unknowns. Most equations you have seen are not linear. For example, \\(xy = 1.\\) or \\(e^{x_1} + x_2 + x_3 = -1.\\) . In general, linear equations are the simplest types of mathematical equations so we better be able to handle them quickly and efficiently. Solving a single linear equation . Say we wanted to solve the equation \\(-x_1 + 2x_2 - 3x_3 + 4x_4 = 5\\) How would we go about doing this? . First, we need to be a bit more precise about what we mean to “solve the equation”. What we want here is often called a *parametric” representation of the solution. We want to identify some free variables that can be used to determine all the solutions explicitly. As you might have done or seen before, this can be accomplished by “solving out” a variable using the equation. We can rewrite the equation as \\(x_1 = 2x_2 - 3x_3 + 4x_4 - 5\\) . Now, given any possible values of $(x_2,x_3,x_4)$, we can use the new form of the equation to find a value for $x_1$ so that we solve the equation. For example, if we take $(1,1,1)$, then plug in to get \\(x_1 = 2 \\cdot 1 - 3 \\cdot 1 + 4 \\cdot 1 -5 = -2\\) and $(-2,1,1,1)$ is a solution to the equation. Great! You might think we have mastered single linear equations. To find the solution to \\(a_1 x_1 + \\cdots + a_m x_m = b\\) in general, we pick some $a_i \\neq 0$ and then we can solve for $x_i$ as \\(x_i = b - \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\frac{a_j}{a_i} x_j\\) . We can try another example to test our understanding. How about solving \\(x_2 - x_4 = 2\\) . One possible point of confusion is: how many variables are we using? We only see 2 in the equation but the biggest index is a 4. So are we using 2 unknowns or 4 unknowns? We will often infer the number of unknowns in the linear equation (and system) from the context. The convention we will use will be this is an equation in 4 unknowns. But, do not be afraid to ask for clarification. Back to the example. Let us pick $x_4$ to solve out \\(x_4 = x_2 - 2\\) Then, our general (parametric) solution would look like $(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_2-2)$. We might be satisfied with our understanding but there is actually one case that breaks our algorithm. What happens if all $a_i = 0$ and $b \\neq 0$, say $b = 1$? Then, we are looking at an immediate problem \\(0 = 1\\) is not satisfiable for any values of our unknowns. In this case, there are no solutions. This situation may seem contrived. Often in mathematics, a general understanding often hinges on properly understanding the edge cases of a problem. Linear algebra is no different. Encountering \\(0 = 1\\) will be a natural possibility once we have developed enough tools. Before we turn to systems of linear equations, let’s recap some important points: . Algorithm for solving a linear equation: . We can write the algorithm for solving $a_1x_1 + \\cdots + a_mx_m = b$ described above in pseudo-code. if all a_i == 0 and b != 0: return No Solution else if all a_i == 0 and b == 0: return [x_1,...,x_m] else: pick i with a_i != 0 set x_i = (a_1/a_i)*x_1-...-(a_{i-1}/a_i)*x_{i-1} - (a_{i+1}/a_i)*x_{i+1} - ... -(a_m/a_1)*x_m return [x_1,...,x_m] . Dichotomy of solutions: . For a linear equation, $a_1x_1 + \\cdots a_mx_m = b$, we have three possibilities . | there can be infinitely-many solutions (if $m &gt; 1$ and either not all $a_i$ are $0$ or $b = 0$), | there can be a unique solution (if $m = 1$ and either not all $a_i$ are $0$ or $b = 0$), or | there can be no solutions at all (if all $a_i$ are $0$ and $b \\neq 0$). | . We will see this dichotomy continues to hold for systems of linear equations. ",

This is it.) . A matrix is square if $n = m$. The diagonal of $A$ is the set of where the two indices are equal, i.e. $a_{11}, a_{22}, \\ldots, a_{dd}$ where $d = \\operatorname{min}(m,n)$. We can extract lists of vectors from a matrix $A$ in (at least) two ways: . | The set of columns vectors of $A$ is the collection \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} \\\\ a_{21} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_{n1} \\end{pmatrix} \\ , \\ \\begin{pmatrix} a_{12} \\\\ a_{22} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_{n2} \\end{pmatrix} \\ , \\ \\cdots \\ , \\ \\begin{pmatrix} a_{1m} \\\\ a_{2m} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_{nm} \\end{pmatrix}\\) Note that we get $m$ vectors of length $n$ in this fashion. Each vector comes from reading down a single column. | The set of row vectors of $A$ is the collection \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} \\\\ a_{12} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_{1m} \\end{pmatrix} \\ , \\ \\begin{pmatrix} a_{21} \\\\ a_{22} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_{2m} \\end{pmatrix} \\ , \\ \\cdots \\ , \\ \\begin{pmatrix} a_{n1} \\\\ a_{n2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_{nm} \\end{pmatrix}\\) Note that we get $n$ vectors of length $m$ in this fashion. Each vector comes from reading across a single row of $A$. | . Here you might notice that the strange notational choice for scalar multiplication of vectors would yield a more natural way of extracting the rows \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{1m} \\end{pmatrix} \\ , \\ \\begin{pmatrix} a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{2m} \\end{pmatrix} \\ , \\ \\cdots \\ , \\ \\begin{pmatrix} a_{n1} &amp; a_{n2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{nm} \\end{pmatrix}\\) It is natural to therefore think of both $n \\times 1$ and $1 \\times m$ matrices as being vectors since are both lists with a single index. In fact, there is a natural operation on matrices which exchanges row and column vectors. Given a matrix $A = (a_{ij})$, its transpose $A^t$ flips the two indices. More precisely, \\(A^t := \\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{21} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{n1} \\\\ a_{12} &amp; a_{22} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{n2} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ a_{1m} &amp; a_{2m} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{mn} \\end{pmatrix}\\) . The notation might be seem subtle to you so let’s see an example. Suppose \\(A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 \\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\\\ 5 &amp; 6 \\end{pmatrix}\\) Then the column vectors of $A$ are \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\ , \\ \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}\\) while the row vectors of $A$ are \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\ , \\ \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\ , \\ \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}\\) . We can compute the transpose \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 \\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\\\ 5 &amp; 6 \\end{pmatrix}^t = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 \\\\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 6 \\end{pmatrix}\\) The entries $1$ and $4$ on the diagonal don’t move and everything else is reflected over it.

Given a scalar $a$ and a matrix $B$, we can multiply them to yield a new matrix $aB$ \\(a \\begin{pmatrix} b_{11} &amp; b_{12} &amp; \\cdots &amp; b_{1m} \\\\ b_{21} &amp; b_{22} &amp; \\cdots &amp; b_{2m} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ b_{n1} &amp; b_{n2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; b_{nm} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} ab_{11} &amp; ab_{12} &amp; \\cdots &amp; ab_{1m} \\\\ ab_{21} &amp; ab_{22} &amp; \\cdots &amp; ab_{2m} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ ab_{n1} &amp; ab_{n2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; ab_{nm} \\end{pmatrix}\\) Similar to multiplication of a scalar and a vector we scale each entry of $B$ by $a$. Matrix multiplication . We now arrive at a type of multiplication that might seem new and strange to some. Given an $A$ an $n \\times m$ matrix and $B$ an $m \\times k$ matrix, we can multiply them to yield $AB$ an $n \\times k$ matrix. Let me repeat: you can only multiply $A$ and $B$ if the number of columns of $A$ equals the number of rows of $B$. An observant reader will notice that this is not a symmetric condition in general. A $2 \\times 3$ multiplied by a $3 \\times 1$ matrix is fine. But $3 \\times 1$ times $2 \\times 3$ is not. The formula for the $(i,j)$ entry in the product $AB$ is \\((AB)_{ij} := \\sum_{s = 1}^m A_{is}B_{sj}\\) . You might recognize a similarity to the formula for multiplication of vectors. Indeed, if $A$ is a $1 \\times m$ matrix and $B$ is a $m \\times 1$ matrix, then $AB$ is exactly the product of $A$ and $B$ considered as vectors. The general formula can be understand this way: the $(i,j)$ entry of $AB$ is the product of the $i$-th row vector of $A$ and the $j$-th column vector of $B$. Let us see this in an example. Take \\(A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 \\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\\\ 5 &amp; 6 \\end{pmatrix} \\ , \\ B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; -1 &amp; -2 &amp; -3 \\\\ -4 &amp; -5 &amp; -6 &amp; -7 \\end{pmatrix}\\) Then $AB$ is well-defined but $BA$ is not. We break $A$ into its row vectors \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\ , \\ \\begin{pmatrix} 3 &amp; 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\ , \\ \\begin{pmatrix} 5 &amp; 6 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and $B$ into its column vectors \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix} \\ , \\ \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\ , \\ \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -6 \\end{pmatrix} \\ , \\ \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -7 \\end{pmatrix}\\) Now we compute each product of a row vector of $A$ with a column vector of $B$. There are 12.

    "content": "With our knowledge of linear equations, the notion of a system is pretty quick to state. A system of linear equations in the variables $x_1,\\ldots,x_m$ is a (finite) set of linear equations in $x_i$’s. Let us use $n$ to denote the number of equations we have. Then, we are saying that, for any $1 \\leq i \\leq n$ and $1 \\leq j \\leq m$, there are $a_{ij}$ and $b_i$ and equations . \\[a_{11} x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \\cdots a_{1m} x_m = b_1 \\\\ a_{21} x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \\cdots a_{2m} x_m = b_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_{n1} x_1 + a_{n2}x_2 + \\cdots a_{nm} x_m = b_n \\\\\\] We need two indices now: one to account for the number of equations and another for the number of unknowns. We were already introduced to an example \\(0 = \\frac{1}{4} x - \\frac{1}{3} y \\\\ {} \\\\ 0 = - \\frac{1}{2} x + \\frac{1}{3} y\\) . In this case $n = m = 2$. For a system where $n = m$, we will call it square. We can generalize our method for computing solutions to the linear equations to handle systems in a straightforward manner. Let us see it in effect for the example above. First, we pick a nonzero coefficient, called a pivot in general. In this case lets take the $1/4$ on the $x$. Now we try to solve out \\(0 = \\frac{1}{4} x - \\frac{1}{3} y\\) for $x$. We get \\(x = \\frac{4}{3} y.\\) . Now we can substitute $x = 4y/3$ to eliminate $x$ from the next equation: \\(0 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{4}{3} y \\right) + \\frac{1}{3} y = - \\frac{1}{3} y\\) which we can solve for $y$ to get $y = 0$. Now we can substitute $y = 0$ back into $x = 4y/3$ and get $x = 0$. We can now answer the question in the original motivating example: the only steady state solution is where there are no aliens of either type. Sensible but perhaps not particularly interesting. From this, we can see that this algorithm for solving a system of linear equations just repeatedly applies the algorithm for solving a single linear equation until there are no more linear equations or we run into No Solution. Algorithm for solving a system of linear equations: . We can write this algorithm for a general system in pseudo-code. We write algorithm_single_equation(l) for the application of the algorithm for a single linear equation to a linear equation l. variables = [x_1,...,x_m] linear equations = [l_1,...,l_n] while number of equations != 0: pick l in linear equations if algorithm_single_equation(l) == No Solution: return No Solution else: if algorithm_single_equation(l)[i] != x_i: set x_i = algorithm_single_equation(l)[i] remove l from linear equations for each l' in linear equations: substitute algorithm_single_equation(l) into l' return [x_1,...,x_m] . In words, we pick a nonzero linear equation. Either we eliminate a variable or we have a contradiction (where $0$ equals $\\neq 0$). If we have a contradiction, we stop because we have no solution. Otherwise, we eliminate the chosen variable by rewriting it using the chosen equation. Then, we substitute back into all the remaining equations and repeat until we have no more equations left. This algorithm is a bit more opaque than the one for a single equation. Ask yourself: is it clear that we always output either . | No Solution | A single solution | Infinitely many solutions? | . It also is not the most efficient one. To gain better understanding and more power, we need some tools - vectors and matrices. ",
