## Adjunctions and derivation

Suppose we are given two additive functors between abelian categories 
$F: \mathcal A \to \mathcal B$ and $G: \mathcal B \to \mathcal A$ 
which form an adjoint $F \vdash G$. 

These immediately yield an adjoint pair at the level of the homotopy 
categories
$$
    F: K(\mathcal A) \leftrightarrows K(\mathcal B) : G
$$

**Lemma**. Assume that $\mathcal A$ has enough projectives and 
countable sums while $\mathcal B$ has enough injectives and countable 
products. Then we have adjoint pair $\mathbf{L}F \vdash \mathbf{R}G$. 

{% proof %}
Let $P \to X$ be a quasi-isomorphism with $P$ K-projective and 
let $Y \to I$ be a quasi-isomorphism with $I$ K-injective. 
We have a chain of natural isomorphisms
$$
    \begin{aligned}
        \operatorname{Hom}_{D(\mathcal B)}(\mathbf{L}F X, Y ) & \cong
        \operatorname{Hom}_{D(\mathcal B)}(F P, Y) \\
        & \cong \operatorname{Hom}_{K(\mathcal B)}(FP,I) \\
        & \cong \operatorname{Hom}_{K(\mathcal A)}(P,GI) \\
        & \cong \operatorname{Hom}_{D(\mathcal A)}(X,GI) \\
        & \cong \operatorname{Hom}_{D(\mathcal A)}(X,\mathbf{R}GY)
    \end{aligned}
$$
{% endproof %}

## Composition and derivation

Now let's assume that we have additive functors between abelian 
categories $F_1: \mathcal A \to \mathcal B$ and $F_2: \mathcal B 
\to \mathcal C$. 

In general, 
$$
    \mathbf{R}F_1 \circ \mathbf{R}F_2 \not \cong \mathbf{R}(F_1 \circ F_2)
$$
and similarly for left derived functors. 

**Example**. Let's consider $k$ as a bimodule over $k[x]$ and look at the 
functor 
$$
    F := - \otimes_{k[x]} k : \operatorname{Mod} k[x] \to \operatorname{Mod} k[x]
$$  
If $\mathbf{L}F \circ \mathbf{L}F \cong \mathbf{L} F^2$, we would have 
$$
    M \overset{\mathbf{L}}{\otimes}_{k[x]} \overset{\mathbf{L}}{\otimes}_{k[x]} k 
    \cong M \overset{\mathbf{L}}{\otimes}_{k[x]} k \otimes_{k[x]} k
$$
In particular, if we took $M = R$, then we would need
$$
    k \overset{\mathbf{L}}{\otimes}_{k[x]} k \cong k \otimes_{k[x]} k
$$
which is problematic since 
$$
    H^{-1}( k \overset{\mathbf{L}}{\otimes}_{k[x]} k ) = k. 
$$

However, there are some situations where the composition of derived 
functors is equal to the derived functor of the composition. 

**Proposition**. Assume that $\mathcal A$ has enough injectives $I$ for 
which $F_1I$ is adapted to $F_2$. Then the natural map 
$$
    \mathbf{R}F_1 \circ \mathbf{R}F_2 \not \cong \mathbf{R}(F_1 \circ F_2)
$$
is a quasi-isomorphism.

{% proof %}
We can compute $\mathbf{R}F_2$ applied to $\mathbf{R}F_1 X$ using 
$\mathbf{R}F_1 X$ itself
