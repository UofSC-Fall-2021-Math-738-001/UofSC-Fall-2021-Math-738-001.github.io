## Representing functors by objects

We say a functor $F : \mathcal C^{op} \to \operatorname{Set}$ is _representable_ if 
there exists $X \in \mathcal C$ and a natural isomorphism $h^X \cong F$. 

Constructing a functor and then seeking representability is a basic technique in 
category theory. In general, you can dream up functors more freely than objects. 
Being the representable object then gives a strong understanding of how $X$ 
interacts with all objects in $\mathcal C$. 

## Examples

- Let $\lbrace \ast \rbrace$ be a one-element set. We can make a functor 
$$
    FX  := \lbrace \ast \rbrace \\
    F(f) := 1_{\lbrace \ast \rbrace}
$$
On its face this functor seems silly. If $h^X \cong F$, then we know that 
$$
    \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal C}(Y,X) = \lbrace \ast \rbrace
$$
for any $Y \in \mathcal C$. In other words, for any $Y$ there is a unique map 
$X \to Y$. We call such $X$ a _terminal object_ of $\mathcal C$ if it exists.
