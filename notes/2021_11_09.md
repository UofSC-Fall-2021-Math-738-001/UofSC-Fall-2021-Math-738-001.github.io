## Brown Representability 

Existence of semi-orthogonal decompositions and if Serre functors 
strongly depending on representability of functors. It is useful to 
have strong general criteria for such. 

Here we will review a criteria for "large" categories: compactly 
generated triangulated categories. [Next]({% link notes/2021_11_11.md %}) 
we will cover one for "small" categories, often categories of 
compact objects in compactly generated triangulated categories. 

Recall that a functor $H: \mathcal T^{op} \to \operatorname{Ab}$ is 
_cohomological_ if for any triangle 
$$
    X \to Y \to Z \to X[1]
$$
the resulting sequence 
$$
    \cdots \rightarrow \operatorname{Hom}(X,W) \rightarrow \operatorname{Hom}(Y,W) 
    \rightarrow \operatorname{Hom}(Z,W) \rightarrow \operatorname{Hom}(X[1],W) 
    \rightarrow \cdots 
$$
is exact. 

We say that $H$ _takes coproducts to products_ if the natural map
$$
    H\left(\bigoplus X_a \right) \to \prod H(X_a) 
$$
is an isomorphism for any coproduct. 

**Theorem**. (Brown Representability) Let $\mathcal T$ be a compactly 
generated triangulated category and $H : \mathcal T^{op} \to \operatorname{Ab}$ 
a functor. Then $H$ is representable if and only if $H$ is cohomological and 
takes coproducts to products. 

{% proof %}
We have seen that representable functors must take triangles to long exact 
sequences and coproducts to products. So assume
