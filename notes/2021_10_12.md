## Derived Morita equivalence

**Definition**. We say that two rings $R$ and $S$ are _derived 
Morita equivalent_ if $D(R) \cong D(S)$. 

The next goal will be to prove the following theorem of Rickard. 

**Theorem**. If $R$ and $S$ are derived Morita equivalent, then 
there exists a $U \in D(R \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} S)$ such that 
$$
    - \overset{\mathbf{L}}{\otimes}_R U : D(R) \to D(S)
$$
is an equivalence. 

As a corollary of this, we know that 
$$
    \mathbf{R}\operatorname{Hom}_S(U,-) : D(S) \to D(R) 
$$
is also an equivalence. 

We start slowly.

**Lemma**. Assume that $R$ and $S$ are derived Morita 
equivalent. Then there exists a perfect complex of $S$-
modules $P$ with 
$$
    \operatorname{Hom}_{D(S)}(P,P) \cong R, \\
    \operatorname{Hom}_{D(S)}(P,P[i]) = 0 \text{ for } i \neq 0,
$$
and 
$$
    \overline{\langle P \rangle} = \operatorname{perf} S
$$

{% proof %}
Given an equivalence $F: D(R) \to D(S)$ we set $P := F(R)$. Then
$$
    F: \operatorname{Hom}_{D(R)}(R,R[i]) \overset{\sim}{\to} 
    \operatorname{Hom}_{D(S)}(P,P[i])
$$
is an isomorphism. 

Also, $P$ generates as $\operatorname{perf} S$ as $R$ 
generates $\operatorname{perf} S$. 
{% endproof %}

**Definition**. An object $P$ in a triangulated category $\mathcal T$ 
is called _tilting_ if 
- 
$$
    \operatorname{Hom}(P,P[i]) = 0 \text{ for } i \neq 0
$$
- 
$$
    \overline{\langle P \rangle} = \mathcal T
$$
