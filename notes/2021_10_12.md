## Derived Morita equivalence

**Definition**. We say that two rings $R$ and $S$ are _derived 
Morita equivalent_ if $D(R) \cong D(S)$. 

The next goal will be to prove the following theorem of Rickard. 

**Theorem**. If $R$ and $S$ are derived Morita equivalent, then 
there exists a $U \in D(R \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} S)$ such that 
$$
    - \overset{\mathbf{L}}{\otimes}_R U : D(R) \to D(S)
$$
is an equivalence. 

As a corollary of this, we know that 
$$
    \mathbf{R}\operatorname{Hom}_S(U,-) : D(S) \to D(R) 
$$
is also an equivalence. 

We start slowly.

**Lemma**. Assume that $R$ and $S$ are derived Morita 
equivalent. Then there exists a perfect complex of $S$-
modules $P$ with 
$$
    \operatorname{Hom}_{D(S)}(P,P) \cong R, \\
    \operatorname{Hom}_{D(S)}(P,P[i]) = 0 \text{ for } i \neq 0,
$$
and 
$$
    \overline{\langle P \rangle} = \operatorname{perf} S
$$

{% proof %}
Given an equivalence $F: D(R) \to D(S)$ we set $P := F(R)$. Then
$$
    F: \operatorname{Hom}_{D(R)}(R,R[i]) \overset{\sim}{\to} 
    \operatorname{Hom}_{D(S)}(P,P[i])
$$
is an isomorphism. 

Also, $P$ generates as $\operatorname{perf} S$ as $R$ 
generates $\operatorname{perf} S$. 
{% endproof %}

**Definition**. An object $P$ in a triangulated category $\mathcal T$ 
is called a _generator_ if 
$$
    \overline{\langle P \rangle} = \mathcal T
$$
If $\mathcal S$ is compactly generated and 
$$
    \overline{\langle P \rangle} = \mathcal S^c
$$
we say $P$ is a _compact generator_. 

$P$ is called _tilting_ if 
$$
    \operatorname{Hom}(P,P[i]) = 0 \text{ for } i \neq 0
$$

For a nice enough compactly generated triangulated, a compact 
generator captures everything. In particular, for derived 
categories of abelian categories. 

But to precisely state how this works we need to take a digression 
into differential graded algebras and modules over them.

**Definition**. Let $k$ be a commutative ring. A _differential graded 
algebra_ or _dg-algebra_ or _DGA_ is $k$-algebra $A$ with a 
decomposition as $k$-modules
$$
    A = \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{Z} } A^i
$$
and $k$-linear maps 
$$
    \delta^i : A^i \to A^{i+1}
$$
such that 
- multiplication is of degree $0$ 
$$
    A^i \cdot A^j \subseteq A^{i+j}
$$
- $\delta$ is a $k$-linear differential: 
$\delta^0(1) = 0$ and $\delta^{i+1} \delta^i = 0$ for all $i$
- $\delta$ satisfies the graded Liebniz rule for multiplication in $A$ 
$$
    \delta(aa^\prime) = \delta(a)a^\prime + (-1)^{|a|} a \delta(a^\prime)
$$
where $a$ and $a^\prime$ are homogeneous of degrees $|a|$ and $|a^\prime|$. 

A _dg-module_ $M$ over a dg-algebra $A$ is an $A$-module with a $k$-module 
decomposition
$$
    M = \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{Z} } M^i
$$
and differential 
$$
    \delta^i : M^i \to M^{i+1} 
$$
such that 
- 
$$
    A^i \cdot M^j \subseteq M^{i+j}
$$
