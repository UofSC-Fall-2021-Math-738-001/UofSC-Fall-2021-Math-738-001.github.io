## A glimpse of the future

We step into the future of the class and attempt to explain the terminology 
of kernels and integral transformations. 

Let $p: X \to S$ be a scheme over a base scheme $S$. Here you should 
think $X$ and $S$ are "locally look like rings" but are 
have global geometry. 

The replacement for modules rings will be the category of quasi-coherent 
sheaves $\operatorname{Qcoh} X$ on $X$. Given a map $f: X \to Y$ of 
schemes over $S$, we get a few operations on quasi-coherent sheaves.
