Then the path algebra $RQ$ is the free $R$-module on the set of paths in $Q$ with multiplication given by path concatenation. For a particularly simple example, consider the following quiver . and use $Q$ to denote it also. Then we have four paths. The two arrows we will denote as $a$ and $b$ plus the length $0$ loops at the two nodes, $e_0$ and $e_1$. Thus \\(RQ = Re_0 \\oplus Ra \\oplus Rb \\oplus Re_1\\) and the nonzero products are \\(ae_0 = a = e_1a \\ , \\ be_0 = b = e_1b \\ , \\ e_0^2 = e_0 \\ , \\ e_1^2 = e_1.\\) . Let $M$ be a $RQ$-module. Let us repackage the information present in the $RQ$-module structure in terms of more familiar data. Note that \\(1 = e_0 + e_1\\) in $RQ$. So we can write \\(M = e_0 M \\oplus e_1 M.\\) For shorthand, set $M_i = e_i M$. Each $M_i$ is only an $R$-module. For each arrow $a$ in $Q$, action by $a$ gives a map \\(\\phi_a : M_{h(a)} \\to M_{t(a)}\\) which is $R$-linear. So we have an assignment \\(M \\mapsto \\lbrace M_i, \\phi_a : M_{h(a)} \\to M_{t(a)} \\mid i \\in Q_0, a \\in Q_1 \\rbrace\\) This process is reversible. Given $(M_i, \\phi_a)$, we set \\(M = \\bigoplus_i M_i\\) and let $a$ act by $\\phi_a$ on $M$. Given a morphism $f : M \\to M^\\prime$ of $RQ$-modules, since $f(e_i M) = e_i f(M)$ we see we have induced maps $f_i : M_i \\to M_i^\\prime$. Since $f(am) = af(m)$, we see that \\(f_i \\circ \\phi_a = \\phi_a \\circ f_i\\) for any arrow $a$. This process is also reversible. Thus the data of $RQ$-modules and their morphisms is the same as collections of $R$-modules indexed by vertices with $R$-linear maps indexed by arrows of $Q$.

We will make this precise in a moment. | Take $R = S = k[x]$ and $P = k[y,z]$ with the bimodule structure given by $x \\mapsto y$ and $x \\mapsto z$. To compute $\\operatorname{Hom}_{k[x]}(k[y,z],-)$ we will write a presentation for $k[y,z]$ as a $k[x]$-module. As $k[x]$-module, $k[y,z]$ has a infinite basis given by $z^i$ for $0 \\leq i &lt; \\infty$. Since it is a free module, \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{k[x]}(k[y,z],-) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}_k(k[z],-).\\) We can specify the $k[x]$-module homomorphism by providing a $k$-linear map from $k[z]$.

Two objects $X,Y \\in \\mathcal C$ are isomorphic if there exists morphisms $ f : X \\to Y $ and $ g : Y \\to X$ such that $gf = 1_X$ and $fg = 1_Y$. Since being isomorphic is an equivalence relation, we form the quotient $\\operatorname{Ob} \\mathcal C/ \\sim_{iso}$ by it. A functor $F$ is essentially surjective if the induced map \\(F : \\operatorname{Ob} \\mathcal C \\to \\operatorname{Ob} \\mathcal D/ \\sim_{iso}\\) is surjective. In other words, every object of $\\mathcal D$ is isomorphic to an object in the image of $F$.

Note this is misleading. In general, $F^{-1}$ is only determined up to natural isomorphism. All these definitions are tied closely together by the following fundamental result. Theorem. $F$ is an equivalence if and only if it is full, faithful, and essentially surjective. Proof. Let’s first assume that $F$ is an equivalence. Let $\\nu : F^{-1} F \\to \\operatorname{Id}$ denote the natural isomorphism. We have the following diagram . and we want to check that $\\varphi$ is actually the identity function. Note that, since $\\nu_X$ and $\\nu_Y$ are isomorphisms themselves, the conjugation $\\nu_Y \\circ - \\circ \\nu_X^{-1}$ is a bijection. Since $\\nu$ is natural transformation, we know that . commutes. Thus, \\(\\varphi(f) = \\nu_Y \\circ F^{-1}F(f) \\circ \\nu^{-1}_X = f\\) So $F$ is injective and $F^{-1}$ is surjective. Reversing the roles of $F$ and $F^{-1}$, we see that both are bijective. Since $X \\cong FF^{-1}X$, $X$ is isomorphic to $F$ applied to $F^{-1}X$. Hence, $F$ is essentially surjective. Now assume that $F$ is full, faithful, and essentially surjective. For each $Y \\in \\mathcal D$, pick some $X \\in \\mathcal C$ and isomorphism $\\phi_Y : FX \\to Y$.

We can make a functor \\(\\begin{aligned} FX &amp; := \\ast \\\\ F(f) &amp; := 1_{\\ast} \\end{aligned}\\) On its face this functor seems silly.

In $\\operatorname{Set}$, $\\prod_{i \\in I} X_i$ is the Cartesian product. In $\\operatorname{Mod-}R$, $\\prod_{i \\in I} M_i$ is the Cartesian product with component-wise addition and action of $R$.

Recall the (inverse) limit of a diagram of sets $X_i$ is \\(\\operatorname{lim}_I X_i := \\left\\lbrace x \\in \\prod_{i \\in I} X_i \\mid \\phi_{ij}(x_i) = x_j \\right\\rbrace\\) Using this, for a general $I$-diagram in $\\mathcal C$, we can consider \\(\\begin{aligned} FX := &amp; \\lim \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal C}(X,X_i) \\\\ Ff := &amp; \\lim \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal C}(f,X_i) \\end{aligned}\\) . We already saw the construction of limits in $\\operatorname{Set}$. In $\\operatorname{Mod} R$ and $R\\operatorname{-Alg}$, the set-theoretic construction carries a natural structure of an $R$-module or an $R$-algebra. One particularly common diagram is . The limit over this diagram is called the fiber product or pullback of the diagram. One might think that we can always reduce to an “underlying set-theoretic” construction for representing objects. This is not always the case. Beyond the fact that functors do not need to be representable, the representing object is not necessarily induced from the construction when we are able to forget down to sets. The opposite category of commutative rings is equivalent a category of topological spaces with extra structure and the product in this category does not forget to the set-theoretic product. We can also consider functors $F : \\mathcal C \\to \\operatorname{Set}$ that are represented in the other slot: $h_X \\cong F$ for some $X \\in \\mathcal C$. Each of the functors described above as co version. | If we have an object (co-)representing the functor $FX = \\ast$, then it is called the initial object. | . For $\\operatorname{Set}$, the initial object is $\\empty$. For $\\operatorname{Mod} R$, it is $0$ again. Finally for $R\\operatorname{-Alg}$, the initial object is $R$ itself. | Given a collection of objects $X_i \\in \\mathcal C$ for $i \\in I$ we have \\(FX := \\prod_{i \\in I} \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal C}(X_i,X)\\) The object representing this functor is a called the coproduct of the $X_i$. It is often denoted by $\\bigsqcup_{i \\in I} X_i$. | . For $\\operatorname{Set}$, it is the disjoint union. For $\\operatorname{Mod} R$, it is the direct sum $\\bigoplus_i M_i$. For finite coproducts in $R\\operatorname{-Alg}$, the construction is the tensor product $\\bigotimes_R R_i$. Let’s take a moment to see why. For each $R_i$, we have a homomorphism \\(\\begin{aligned} \\ell_i : R_i &amp; \\to R_1 \\otimes_R \\cdots \\otimes_R R_s \\\\ r_i &amp; \\to 1 \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes r_i \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes 1 \\end{aligned}\\) Given $f : \\bigotimes_R R_i \\to S$, we get $f \\circ \\ell_i : R_i \\to S$. In the inverse direction, if we have $f_i : R_i \\to S$, we can set \\(f\\left( \\sum r_1 \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes r_s \\right) := \\sum f_1(r_1) \\cdots f(r_s)\\) . Infinite coproducts in $R\\operatorname{-Alg}$ also exist. It is the subring of the infinite tensor product generated by elementary tensors with all but finitely entries equal to $1$. | Given a poset $I$ and a diagram $I^{op} \\to \\mathcal C$ we can consider \\(FX := \\lim \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal C}(X_i,X)\\) which is represented by the colimit, when it exists. It is denoted by $\\operatorname{colim}_I X_i$. | . In $\\operatorname{Set}$, the colimit is given by the quotient \\(\\left( \\bigsqcup_{i \\in I} X_i \\right)/\\sim\\) where $\\phi_{ij}(x_j) \\sim x_i$. In $\\operatorname{Mod} R$, the colimit takes a similar form \\(\\bigoplus_i M_i / (\\phi_{ij}(m_j)-m_i).\\) . Finally, for $R\\operatorname{-Alg}$, the analogous formula works. Taking our diagram from from before and reversing the arrows (plus rotating a bit) ask us to fill in the missing node in the square . The resulting object is fiber coproduct or pushout of the diagram. In $R\\operatorname{-Alg}$, the pushout of . is given by the tensor product $S_1 \\otimes_T S_2$. ",

    "content": "Each morphism $\\phi : M \\to N$ in $\\operatorname{Mod} R$ admits a kernel and cokernel. To characterize them via universal property, let us remember the following definitions. Definition. Let $\\delta_i : A_i \\to A_{i+1}$ be a collection of morphisms of abelian groups for $- N &lt; i &lt; M$ (with the possibility that $N = \\infty$ or $M = \\infty$). We say that $(A_\\bullet, \\delta_\\bullet)$ is a complex if \\(\\operatorname{im} \\delta_i \\subseteq \\ker \\delta_{i+1}\\) . The collection is exact if \\(\\operatorname{im} \\delta_i = \\ker \\delta_{i+1}\\) .

These definition are given for the moment in Ab but we will how to make sense of them in an arbitrary abelian category momentarily. With this, we note that $\\ker \\phi$, for $\\phi: M \\to N$ of $R$-modules, fits into the exact sequence of abelian groups: \\(0 \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M^\\prime, \\ker \\phi) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M^\\prime,M) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M^\\prime,N)\\) . Similarly, for the cokernel $\\operatorname{cok} \\phi$, we get an exact sequence \\(0 \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(\\operatorname{cok} \\phi, M^\\prime) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(N,M^\\prime) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,M^\\prime)\\) . Each of these is characterizations is equivalent to a universal lifting/extension property. For the kernel, we have the diagram . which expresses that we get a unique $\\tilde{\\psi}$ if and only if the composition $M^\\prime \\to M \\to N$ is $0$. In other words, we can lift map $\\phi : M^\\prime \\to M$ uniquely over $\\ker \\phi \\to M$ if and only if $\\phi \\circ \\psi = 0$. For the cokernel we have the dual lifting problem . which expresses that we get a unique $\\tilde{\\psi}$ if and if $M \\to N \\to M^\\prime$ is $0$. In a general additive category $\\mathcal A$, given $\\phi : X \\to Y$ we ask about representability of the functors \\(T \\mapsto \\ker\\left( \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(T,X) \\overset{\\phi \\circ -}{\\to} \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(T,Y)\\right)\\) and \\(T \\mapsto \\ker\\left( \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(Y,T) \\overset{- \\circ \\phi}{\\to} \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(X,T)\\right)\\) . If the first is representable, we call it the kernel $\\ker \\phi$. Note that there is natural transformation \\(\\ker\\left( \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(-,X) \\overset{\\phi \\circ -}{\\to} \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(-,Y)\\right) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(-,X)\\) given by forgeting that the map lies in the kernel. Thus we have a unique map $\\alpha : \\ker \\phi \\to X$ if the kernel exists. For the second, we call the representing object the cokernel and write it as $\\operatorname{coker} \\phi$. It comes with a natural map $\\beta: Y \\to \\operatorname{coker} \\phi$. Existence of kernels and cokernels is almost enough for the definition of an abelian category. There is one more condition that holds in $\\operatorname{Mod} R$. For a morphism of modules $\\phi: M \\to N$, the natural map \\(\\operatorname{coker} \\alpha \\to \\operatorname{ker} \\beta\\) is an isomorphism. The first object is often called the coimage while the second is called the image of $\\phi$. In this case, both are isomorphic to the image $\\phi(M)$ submodule of $N$. In general, this is not assured. Definition. An abelian category is an additive category $\\mathcal A$ possessing all kernels and cokernels with the natural maps \\(\\operatorname{coker} \\alpha \\to \\operatorname{ker} \\beta\\) beings isomorphisms. Since the coimage and image coincide, we will just write this as $\\operatorname{im} \\phi$. Given this, we can talk about sub-objects and quotient-objects. A morphism $\\phi: X \\to Y$ exhibits $Y$ as a sub-object of $Y$ if $\\ker \\phi \\cong 0$. Similarly, $Y$ is a quotient object if $\\operatorname{coker} \\phi \\cong 0$. We will just write $X \\subseteq Y$ for a sub-object and $Y = X/Z$ for a quotient object. (Here $Z = \\ker \\phi$). We can now lift our definitions of complexes, exactness, and cohomology to an abelian category $\\mathcal A$ without altering any notation.

Exact sequences of the shape $0 \\to A \\to B \\to C \\to 0$ pop up frequently so they are given a name: a short exact sequence. By convention, a longer exact sequence is often termed long. Examples . | Of course the identity functor is exact. | The forgetful functor $\\operatorname{Mod} R \\to \\operatorname{Ab}$ is exact. | If $F$ is a free $R$-module, then $- \\otimes_R$ is exact.

We will see next that Hom and tensor are not exact in general. They are each “half-exact”. Adjoints and exactness . Given an adjunction $F \\vdash G$ of Ab-enriched functors between abelian categories, we get a some exactness for free. First, since $F$ commutes with coproducts and $G$ commutes with products, we automatically know that $F$ and $G$ are additive.

Let $\\mathcal A$ be a small abelian category. Then there exists a not-necessarily unital ring $R$ and a fully-faithful exact functor \\(\\mathcal A \\to \\operatorname{Mod} R.\\) . We will not provide a proof. See this MO post for a nice dicussion of the proof. The result becomes more immediate in examples where you already have a set of projective generators or injective co-generators in your hand. The hard work in the theorem is cook up an injective co-generator in a bigger category. The main utility of Freyd-Mitchell is that . | we feel good that $\\mathcal A$ is not so far from $\\operatorname{Mod} R$ and | each $\\mathcal A$ admits a faithful functor to $\\operatorname{Set}$ so we can reason using elements of each object $A$ of $\\mathcal A$. | . This semester our main abelian category is $\\operatorname{Mod} R$. While results may be stated more generally, details will usually only be given for justifications involving this example. (Next semester is a globalization of this: $\\operatorname{Qcoh} X$.) . ",

    "content": "We have seen that each of $-\\otimes_R M$, $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,-)$, and $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(-,M)$ is an additive functor. Left exactness of   $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,-)$ . This is almost tautological from the universal property of kernels. For a morphism $\\phi : M \\to N$, we know that \\(0 \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(T,\\ker \\phi) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(T,M) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(T,N)\\) is exact. In other words, we preserve kernels: \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_R(T,\\ker \\phi) \\cong \\ker \\left( \\operatorname{Hom}_R(T,M) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(T,N) \\right)\\) . The same argument in a general abelian category shows that $\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(A,-)$ is left exact. Left exactness (in the opposite category) of   $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(-,M)$ . In the other entry, we get a functor $\\left( \\operatorname{Mod} R \\right)^{op} \\to \\operatorname{Ab}$. The opposite category $\\left( \\operatorname{Mod} R \\right)^{op}$ has the structure of abelian category where we exchange kernels and cokernels. From the universal property of cokernels we know that \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_R(\\operatorname{coker} \\phi, T) \\cong \\ker \\left( \\operatorname{Hom}_R(N,T) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,T) \\right)\\) Reversing the arrows, we see that $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(-,M)$ takes the kernels in $\\left( \\operatorname{Mod} R \\right)^{op}$ to kernels. Again, the same argument works in a general abelian category. Right exactness of   $- \\otimes_R M$ . Assume we have an exact sequence \\(M \\overset{\\mu}{\\to} N \\overset{\\nu}{\\to} C \\to 0\\) in $\\operatorname{Mod} R$. Then $C \\cong M/N$. If we apply $- \\otimes_R T$ we get \\(M \\otimes_R T \\overset{\\mu \\otimes 1}{\\to} N \\otimes_R T \\overset{\\nu \\otimes 1}{\\to} C \\otimes_R T \\to 0\\) and we want to check exactness. We need to first check that each element of $C \\otimes_R T$ is in the image of $N \\otimes_R T$. Pick some element $\\sum c_i \\otimes t_i$. Since $N \\to C$ is surjective, we can find $n_i$ with $n_i \\mapsto c_i$ for each $i$. Then \\(\\sum n_i \\otimes t_i \\mapsto \\sum c_i \\otimes t_i.\\) . Assume we can construct a map $\\lambda: C \\otimes_R T \\to (M \\otimes_R T)/(N \\otimes_R T)$ making the diagram . where the arrows labelled with $=$ are the identity maps. Assume that we have some element $ x \\in N \\otimes_R T$ with $(\\nu \\otimes 1)(x) = 0$. Then, we also know that $\\pi(x) = 0$. So there exists a $y \\in M \\otimes_R T$ with $(\\mu \\otimes 1)(y) = x$ giving exactness at $N \\otimes_R T$. Now we turn to making $\\lambda$ using the universal property of tensor products. Consider \\(\\begin{aligned} C \\times T &amp; \\to (N \\otimes_R T)/(M \\otimes_R T) \\\\ (c,t) &amp; \\mapsto \\overline{\\tilde{c} \\otimes t} \\end{aligned}\\) where $\\tilde{c}$ is a choice of element of $N$ such that $\\nu(\\tilde{c}) = c$. We need to check this is well-defined and $R$-bilinear. Any other lift of $c$ is of the form $\\tilde{c} + n$ for some $n \\in N$. We have \\(\\overline{(\\tilde{c} + n) \\otimes t} = \\overline{\\tilde{c} \\otimes t + n \\otimes t} = \\overline{\\tilde{c} \\otimes t}.\\) Thus the function is well-defined. Since $\\tilde{c}r$ is a lift of $cr$, we see that we have an $R$-bilinear function. Thus, we get a unique $\\lambda : C \\otimes_R T \\to (N \\otimes_R T)/(M \\otimes_R T)$ with \\(\\lambda(c \\otimes t) = \\overline{\\tilde{c} \\otimes t}\\) This gives us the desired diagram and finishes the argument. Non-exactness . Consider $k[x]$ for $k$ a field. And write $k = k[x]/(x)$. We have an exact sequence \\(0 \\to k[x] \\overset{x}{\\to} k[x] \\to k \\to 0\\) If we apply $\\operatorname{Hom}_{k[x]}(k,-)$ this turns into \\(0 \\to 0 \\to 0 \\to k \\to 0\\) which is not exact at $k$. Hence $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,-)$ is not right exact in general. If we apply $- \\otimes_{k[x]} k$ to our exact sequence instead we get \\(0 \\to k \\overset{0}{\\to} k \\to k \\to 0\\) which show that $- \\otimes_R M$ is not left exact in general. Similarly, if we apply $\\operatorname{Hom}_{k[x]}(-,k)$, we get \\(0 \\leftarrow k \\overset{0}{\\leftarrow} k \\leftarrow k \\leftarrow 0\\) which shows that $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(-,M)$ is not right exact in general.

    "content": "For what modules $M$ is $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,-)$ exact? $- \\otimes_R M$? $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(-,M)$ . Projectives . We already saw that if $F$ is free $R$-module then $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(F,-)$ is exact. We can take one step away from this. Recall that $X$ is a retract of an object $Y$ in a category $\\mathcal C$ if there exists maps \\(\\begin{aligned} i : X &amp; \\to Y \\\\ \\pi : Y &amp; \\to X \\end{aligned}\\) with $\\pi \\circ i = 1_X$. If $P$ is a retract of $F$, then $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(P,-)$ is exact also. Indeed, we have a retraction of functors \\(\\begin{aligned} \\operatorname{Hom}_R(\\pi,-) : \\operatorname{Hom}_R(P,-) &amp; \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(F,-) \\\\ \\operatorname{Hom}_R(i,-) : \\operatorname{Hom}_R(F,-) &amp; \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(P,-) \\end{aligned}\\) so we only need to establish that retracts of exact complexes are again exact. We should promote chain complexes to a category by providing morphisms between chain complexes. A morphism $\\phi_\\bullet : (A_\\bullet, \\delta^A_\\bullet) \\to (B_\\bullet, \\delta^B_\\bullet)$ is a collection of morphisms $\\phi_i : A_i \\to B_i$ for which all squares . commute. Given an abelian category $\\mathcal A$, we denote the category of chain complexes by $Ch(\\mathcal A)$. Assume we have a retraction in $Ch(\\mathcal A)$. This translates into a commutative diagram of which we prune at bit . Given $a \\in A_{i+1}$ with $\\delta_{i+1} (a) = 0$, then its image $b$ in $B_{i+1}$ also satisfies $\\delta_{i+1}(b) = 0$. From exactness of $B_\\bullet$, there exists a $b^\\prime$ with $\\delta_i(b^\\prime) = b$. Applying the map to $A_\\bullet$ gives an element of $A_i$, $a^\\prime$, with $\\delta_i(a^\\prime) = a$. We can represent this “diagram chase” via the following picture: . Definition. A object $P$ of an abelian category is projective if $\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(P,-)$ is exact. Proposition. In $\\operatorname{Mod} R$, the projective objects are exactly the retracts of free modules. Proof. The above shows that in $\\operatorname{Mod} R$ retracts of free modules are projective. Assume that $P$ is a projective object. There exists a surjection $F \\overset{\\pi}{\\to} P \\to 0$. We can lift the identity . which exhibits $P$ as a retract of $F$. This is satisfying statement: we have an explicit construction of all projective objects. As a consequence, we have enough projectives in $\\operatorname{Mod} R$. In an abelian category $\\mathcal A$, we say have enough projectives if for any objects $X$ there exists $P \\twoheadrightarrow X$ for some projective $P$. Let us also note that if $P_i$ are projective for $i \\in I$, then $\\bigoplus_{i \\in I} P_i$ is also projective in a general $\\mathcal A$. Since \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}\\left( \\bigoplus P_i, M \\right) \\cong \\prod \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(P_i, M)\\) and products of exact sequences remain exact. Injectives . Definition. In an abelian category, we call an object $I$ injective if $\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(-,I)$ is exact. This is the extension problem . Let’s look at injective objects of $\\operatorname{Mod} R$. Assume that $I$ is an injective module. Then we have a more easily-verified extension problem. For any ideal $J \\leq R$, we know that we can extend over inclusions of ideals . This is enough to characterize injectives. Lemma. (Baer’s Criteria) If $I$ extends over any $J \\leq R$, then $I$ is injective. Proof. Assume we have the diagram . and form a partially order set \\(\\lbrace (M^\\prime, \\psi^\\prime) \\mid N \\subseteq M^\\prime \\subseteq M \\text{ and } \\psi^\\prime|_{N} = \\psi \\rbrace\\) We say $(M_1^\\prime, \\psi_1^\\prime) &lt; (M_2^\\prime, \\psi_2^\\prime)$ if $M_1^\\prime \\subseteq M_2^\\prime$ and $\\psi_2^\\prime|_{M_1^\\prime} = \\psi_1^\\prime$. Then we have a partially order set and we can form upper bounds for any chain by taking unions. By Zorn’s Lemma, we just need to check the maximal element is all of $M$. Assume not and let $m \\in M \\setminus M^\\prime$ for maximal $(M^\\prime, \\psi^\\prime)$. Let \\(J := Rm \\cap M^\\prime \\leq R/\\operatorname{Ann}(m)\\) If $J = 0$, we can extend the map by setting $\\psi^\\prime(m) = 0$. Otherwise, let $\\tilde{J} = \\pi^{-1}(J)$ for the projection $\\pi: R \\to R/\\operatorname{Ann}(m)$. It suffices to solve the extension problem . By assumption we can do exactly this. Using this we can get some injectives in $\\operatorname{Ab} = \\operatorname{Mod} \\mathbb{Z}$. Any ideal in $\\mathbb{Z}$ is of the form $(m)$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, to extend . we need to find a $x \\in I$ with $mx = \\psi(m)$. In other words, we need to divide $x$ by $m$. We can always do this for $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}$ - giving two injective modules. Using $\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}$ and some tricks, we demonstrate that $\\operatorname{Mod} R$ has enough injectives. Definition. An abelian category $\\mathcal A$ has enough injectives if for any object $X$ there exists $X \\hookrightarrow I$ with $I$ injective. Proposition. $\\operatorname{Mod} R$ has enough injectives. Proof. Let \\(I := \\operatorname{Hom}_\\mathbb{Z}(R,\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z})\\) . Note that, by tensor-Hom adjunction, we have \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,I) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}_\\mathbb{Z}(M,\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z})\\) Since \\(M \\mapsto \\operatorname{Hom}_\\mathbb{Z}(M,\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z})\\) is exact, we see that $I$ is injective. One can check that for any abelian group $A$ \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_\\mathbb{Z}(A,\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}) = 0\\) Pick some $0 \\neq a \\in A$ and then $\\mathbb{Z}a = \\mathbb{Z}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$. \\(\\begin{aligned} \\operatorname{Hom}_\\mathbb{Z}(\\mathbb{Z},\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}) &amp; = \\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z} \\neq 0 \\\\\\ \\operatorname{Hom}_\\mathbb{Z}(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z},\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}) &amp; = (\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z})_m \\neq 0 \\end{aligned}\\) where $(-)_m$ is the $m$-torsion. (Note here is where $\\mathbb{Q}$ doesn’t work.) We have a map \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_\\mathbb{Z}(A,\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}) \\twoheadrightarrow \\operatorname{Hom}_\\mathbb{Z}(\\mathbb{Z}a,\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z})\\) since $\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}$ is injective. Thus, $\\operatorname{Hom}_\\mathbb{Z}(A,\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}) \\neq 0$. Set $M^\\vee := \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,I)$. Since $I$ is naturally a $R$-bimodule, $M^\\vee$ remains a $R$-module. We claim the map \\(M \\to M^{\\vee\\vee}\\) is injective. If $M \\neq 0$, we know that $M^\\vee \\neq 0$. If we take the kernel $K$ of $M \\to M^{\\vee\\vee}$, then \\(K^{\\vee\\vee} \\hookrightarrow M^{\\vee\\vee}\\) as $I$ is injective. But $K \\to M^{\\vee\\vee}$ is the zero map. Thus $K \\to K^{\\vee\\vee}$ must also be $0$. This implies that $K^\\vee = 0$. Since otherwise, there would be an element $k \\in K$ and nonzero function $\\phi:K \\to I$ with $\\phi(k)$. Thus \\(M \\hookrightarrow M^{\\vee\\vee}\\) . To finish, we choose $F \\twoheadrightarrow M^\\vee$ for a free module $F \\cong R^{\\oplus X}$. Then, we get \\(M \\hookrightarrow M^{\\vee\\vee} = \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M^\\vee, I) \\hookrightarrow \\operatorname{Hom}_R(F,I) \\cong \\prod_X I\\) and note that if $I_j$ for $j \\in J$ are injective then so is $\\prod_J I_J$. Flat modules . Definition. An $R$-module $M$ is called flat if $- \\otimes_R M$ is exact. We have seen that free modules are flat. Similar to the argument above, retracts of free modules are also flat. Thus, projective modules are flat. But in general flat modules are projective. Consider the localization $k[x]_x$ as a $k[x]$-module. This is flat as localization is an exact functor. However it is not projective since any map $k[x]_x \\to k[x]$ must send $1$ to $p \\in k[x]$ which satisfies $x^iq_i = p$ for some $q_i$ any $i \\geq 0$. The only choice for $p$ is $0$. There exists a criteria analogous to Baer’s for flatness. Proposition. $M$ is flat if and only if \\(J \\otimes_R M \\hookrightarrow R \\otimes_R M \\cong M\\) for any ideal $J \\leq R$. We omit the proof. ",

You should submit a request in writing (email is acceptable) stating the dates of the anticipated absence, explaining the reason for absence, providing supporting documentation as required above, and including any request for make-up work. You should submit this request no later than the end of the second week of regularly scheduled classes in a full fall or spring semester term and within twice the length of the drop/add period for any other term. If regularly attending class becomes difficult for any reason, please contact me to discuss the issue. In accordance with university policy, a grade penalty of 10% may be imposed if a student has unexcused absensces exceeding 5% of the total number of courses. For this course, that means missing TWO courses without excuse. All absences due to documented illness or quarantine will be excused, and no grade penalty will be assessed for missing classes for this reason. If you experience COVID-19 symptoms, please stay home, contact the COVID-19 Student Health Services (SHS) nurse line (803-576-8511), complete the COVID-19 Student Report Form and select the option allowing the Student Ombuds to contact your professors. When talking with the SHS nurse, be sure to ask for documentation of the consult as you will need this to document why you missed class. You will also use the COVID-19 Student Report Form if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or if you have been ordered to quarantine because of close contact with a person who was COVID-19 positive. In each of these situations you will be provided appropriate documentation that can be shared through the Student Report Form. ",

    "title": "COVID Policies",
    "content": "As of 8/17/2021, UofSC requires face coverings, including in this class. For more information on this semester’s COVID policies see the guidance from the Provost. I strongly encourage getting vaccinated. I encourage physical distancing. While not always possible, I will strive to keep everyone at least three feet apart, even when working in groups, which we will do regularly. If you feel uncomfortable with group work in my class, please come talk with me and I don’t mind letting you work independently at all. I have been requested to keep a seating chart. I have been urged to keep this seating chart for contact tracing purposes and will do my best to abide by the University policy. Questions You May Have . What if I get sick with COVID? Two things have to occur: Isolation: Students who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are released from isolation when a medical professional has determined, based on the current CDC and DHEC guidelines, that they have recovered. Currently, these guidelines include being fever-free for at least 24 hours and at least 10 days from their first symptom or positive test if they are asymptomatic. Quarantine: Unvaccinated students who are deemed a close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case will be quarantined for 7-14 days from their last contact with the infected individual. More specifically, students who test negative on day 5, 6, or 7 can leave quarantine after 7 full days; individuals who did not test but remain asymptomatic can leave after 10 full days. Individuals who are symptomatic or have other health concerns may be advised to remain under quarantine for 14 days.  . What is the attendance policy if I get COVID? In brief, I must provide make-up course work including content and assignments when students have excused absences which include (but are not limited to) being in quarantine or isolation, religious holidays, medical conditions related to pregnancy, and military duty. However, recorded classes and hybrid/online options are not required and should not be expected. All excused absences must have documentation. See syllabus for further attendance policies. How will the Dr. Ballard know if I am absent due to quarantine or isolation? COVID-19 related absences must be document through the Student Ombudsman.  Students who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or have been exposed and require quarantining should complete the COVID-19 Student Report Form and instructors should request this form in order to excuse the absence.  . Can I inquire about classmates condition with COVID? Sadly, not with me. These are health issues and the information is protected by state and federal law. If an individual student has questions about whether they should quarantine or believe that they have been in close contact, have them reach out to the COVID Phone Bank (803-576-8511). Would we ever change to go online if too many people are sick? Only in the rare instance that 30% or more of students have documented excused absences may I take the course online. This is not to be expected and very complicated according to the current policies. What if Dr. Ballard gets sick with COVID? I have been fully vaccinated and breakthrough infection symptoms most often resemble the common cold. In the event of a breakthrough infection, I will enter the self-isolation period and the course will switch modality to synchronous online temporarily. In the rare circumstance I am unable to teach remotely, a substitute instructor will take over the course. ",

We will show respect for one another by exhibiting patience and courtesy in our exchanges. Appropriate language and restraint from verbal attacks upon those whose perspectives differ from your own is a minimum requirement. Courtesy and kindness is the norm for those who participate in the class. Mistakes, in particular during the running phase, are expected and natural. Mistakes are how learning happens. All students should recognize and respect the bravery of a student presenting a proof or solution. If you ever feel uncomfortable beyond the intellectual challenge of the course, please contact me. Teams is a way for you to share your ideas and learning with your colleagues in this class. We do this as colleagues in learning, and the online space is meant to be a safe and respectful environment for us to conduct these discussions. Some general netiquette rules: . | Treat one another with respect. It will be expected that we will not attack one another personally for holding different opinions. | Do not use all CAPITAL LETTERS in emails or discussion board postings. This is considered “shouting” and is seen as impolite or aggressive. | Begin emails with a proper salutation (Examples: Dr. Name; Ms. Name; Hello Professor Name; Good afternoon Mr. Name). Starting an email without a salutation or a simple “Hey” is not appropriate. | When sending an email, please include a detailed subject line. Additionally, make sure you reference the course number (Ex. ENGL 287) in the message and sign the mail with your name. | Use proper grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Text messaging language is not acceptable. | Use good taste when communicating. Profanity should be avoided. | Re-Read, think, and edit your message before you click “Send/Submit/Post.” . | Please remember when posting to be respectful and courteous to your colleagues, and limit your communication to topics of this course and the assignments. | .

    "content": "Matthew Ballard . ballard@math.sc.edu . Schedule an appointment . I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of South Carolina. I have been teaching mathematics for almost two decades and have guided nearly 1000 students from all levels through math courses. A mindset focused on growth is essential for learning mathematics. Each day is a small step forward. When we turn around at the end of the course, only then, do we see how far we have truly traveled. For more of my pedagogical philosophy and experience, take a look at the teaching page. As an extension of teaching, I take pride in mentoring researchers at any stage. For a brief introduction to my mentees see the mentoring page. In my research, I study algebraic geometry and am particularly interested in questions arising from Homological Mirror Symmetry. Much of my current work focuses on derived categories and their relation to more classical questions. My research has been partially supported by the Simons Foundation and the National Science Foundation. It has also benefited from a membership at the Institute for Advanced Study, funding from UofSC, and the Southeastern Conference. For more information about me, see my CV. For a research summary and a list of my papers, take a look at my research page. I regularly organize mathematical events, even virtual ones. For the full list of events, see the organizing page. If you are interested in participating, contact me. ",
