Then the path algebra $RQ$ is the free $R$-module on the set of paths in $Q$ with multiplication given by path concatenation. For a particularly simple example, consider the following quiver . and use $Q$ to denote it also. Then we have four paths. The two arrows we will denote as $a$ and $b$ plus the length $0$ loops at the two nodes, $e_0$ and $e_1$. Thus \\(RQ = Re_0 \\oplus Ra \\oplus Rb \\oplus Re_1\\) and the nonzero products are \\(ae_0 = a = e_1a \\ , \\ be_0 = b = e_1b \\ , \\ e_0^2 = e_0 \\ , \\ e_1^2 = e_1.\\) . Let $M$ be a $RQ$-module. Let us repackage the information present in the $RQ$-module structure in terms of more familiar data. Note that \\(1 = e_0 + e_1\\) in $RQ$. So we can write \\(M = e_0 M \\oplus e_1 M.\\) For shorthand, set $M_i = e_i M$. Each $M_i$ is only an $R$-module. For each arrow $a$ in $Q$, action by $a$ gives a map \\(\\phi_a : M_{h(a)} \\to M_{t(a)}\\) which is $R$-linear. So we have an assignment \\(M \\mapsto \\lbrace M_i, \\phi_a : M_{h(a)} \\to M_{t(a)} \\mid i \\in Q_0, a \\in Q_1 \\rbrace\\) This process is reversible. Given $(M_i, \\phi_a)$, we set \\(M = \\bigoplus_i M_i\\) and let $a$ act by $\\phi_a$ on $M$. Given a morphism $f : M \\to M^\\prime$ of $RQ$-modules, since $f(e_i M) = e_i f(M)$ we see we have induced maps $f_i : M_i \\to M_i^\\prime$. Since $f(am) = af(m)$, we see that \\(f_i \\circ \\phi_a = \\phi_a \\circ f_i\\) for any arrow $a$. This process is also reversible. Thus the data of $RQ$-modules and their morphisms is the same as collections of $R$-modules indexed by vertices with $R$-linear maps indexed by arrows of $Q$.

We will make this precise in a moment. | Take $R = S = k[x]$ and $P = k[y,z]$ with the bimodule structure given by $x \\mapsto y$ and $x \\mapsto z$. To compute $\\operatorname{Hom}_{k[x]}(k[y,z],-)$ we will write a presentation for $k[y,z]$ as a $k[x]$-module. As $k[x]$-module, $k[y,z]$ has a infinite basis given by $z^i$ for $0 \\leq i &lt; \\infty$. Since it is a free module, \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{k[x]}(k[y,z],-) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}_k(k[z],-).\\) We can specify the $k[x]$-module homomorphism by providing a $k$-linear map from $k[z]$.

Two objects $X,Y \\in \\mathcal C$ are isomorphic if there exists morphisms $ f : X \\to Y $ and $ g : Y \\to X$ such that $gf = 1_X$ and $fg = 1_Y$. Since being isomorphic is an equivalence relation, we form the quotient $\\operatorname{Ob} \\mathcal C/ \\sim_{iso}$ by it. A functor $F$ is essentially surjective if the induced map \\(F : \\operatorname{Ob} \\mathcal C \\to \\operatorname{Ob} \\mathcal D/ \\sim_{iso}\\) is surjective. In other words, every object of $\\mathcal D$ is isomorphic to an object in the image of $F$.

Note this is misleading. In general, $F^{-1}$ is only determined up to natural isomorphism. All these definitions are tied closely together by the following fundamental result. Theorem. $F$ is an equivalence if and only if it is full, faithful, and essentially surjective. Proof. Let’s first assume that $F$ is an equivalence. Let $\\nu : F^{-1} F \\to \\operatorname{Id}$ denote the natural isomorphism. We have the following diagram . and we want to check that $\\varphi$ is actually the identity function. Note that, since $\\nu_X$ and $\\nu_Y$ are isomorphisms themselves, the conjugation $\\nu_Y \\circ - \\circ \\nu_X^{-1}$ is a bijection. Since $\\nu$ is natural transformation, we know that . commutes. Thus, \\(\\varphi(f) = \\nu_Y \\circ F^{-1}F(f) \\circ \\nu^{-1}_X = f\\) So $F$ is injective and $F^{-1}$ is surjective. Reversing the roles of $F$ and $F^{-1}$, we see that both are bijective. Since $X \\cong FF^{-1}X$, $X$ is isomorphic to $F$ applied to $F^{-1}X$. Hence, $F$ is essentially surjective. Now assume that $F$ is full, faithful, and essentially surjective. For each $Y \\in \\mathcal D$, pick some $X \\in \\mathcal C$ and isomorphism $\\phi_Y : FX \\to Y$.

Given a $R$-$S$-bimodule $P$, we have a map \\(\\nu_{N,M}: \\operatorname{Hom}_R(P \\otimes_S N, M) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_S(N, \\operatorname{Hom}_R(P,M)) \\\\ \\phi \\mapsto \\left( n \\mapsto \\left(p \\mapsto \\phi(p \\otimes n) \\right)\\right)\\) Let’s check this givens an adjunction $P \\otimes_S - \\vdash \\operatorname{Hom}_R(P,-)$. First, because $\\phi$ is a $R$-module homomorphism, so is $p \\mapsto \\phi(p \\otimes n)$ for any $n \\in N$. So the function is well-defined. Next, for $n \\to (p \\mapsto \\phi(p \\otimes n))$ to be an $S$-module homomorphism we need \\(\\phi(ps \\otimes n) = \\phi(p \\otimes sn)\\) which is guaranteed by the construction of the tensor product. Now let’s check this is a bijection. Assume we have $\\psi : N \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(P,M)$. Define \\(\\phi(p \\otimes n) := \\psi(n)(p)\\) and \\(\\phi\\left(\\sum_i p_i \\otimes n_i \\right) := \\sum \\phi(p_i \\otimes n_i).\\) We leave it as an exercise to show that $\\psi \\mapsto \\phi$ is well-defined and inverse to $\\nu$.

You should submit this request no later than the end of the second week of regularly scheduled classes in a full fall or spring semester term and within twice the length of the drop/add period for any other term. If regularly attending class becomes difficult for any reason, please contact me to discuss the issue. In accordance with university policy, a grade penalty of 10% may be imposed if a student has unexcused absensces exceeding 5% of the total number of courses. For this course, that means missing TWO courses without excuse. All absences due to documented illness or quarantine will be excused, and no grade penalty will be assessed for missing classes for this reason. If you experience COVID-19 symptoms, please stay home, contact the COVID-19 Student Health Services (SHS) nurse line (803-576-8511), complete the COVID-19 Student Report Form and select the option allowing the Student Ombuds to contact your professors. When talking with the SHS nurse, be sure to ask for documentation of the consult as you will need this to document why you missed class.

    "title": "COVID Policies",
    "content": "As of 8/17/2021, UofSC requires face coverings, including in this class. For more information on this semester’s COVID policies see the guidance from the Provost. I strongly encourage getting vaccinated. I encourage physical distancing. While not always possible, I will strive to keep everyone at least three feet apart, even when working in groups, which we will do regularly. If you feel uncomfortable with group work in my class, please come talk with me and I don’t mind letting you work independently at all. I have been requested to keep a seating chart. I have been urged to keep this seating chart for contact tracing purposes and will do my best to abide by the University policy. Questions You May Have . What if I get sick with COVID? Two things have to occur: Isolation: Students who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are released from isolation when a medical professional has determined, based on the current CDC and DHEC guidelines, that they have recovered. Currently, these guidelines include being fever-free for at least 24 hours and at least 10 days from their first symptom or positive test if they are asymptomatic. Quarantine: Unvaccinated students who are deemed a close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case will be quarantined for 7-14 days from their last contact with the infected individual. More specifically, students who test negative on day 5, 6, or 7 can leave quarantine after 7 full days; individuals who did not test but remain asymptomatic can leave after 10 full days. Individuals who are symptomatic or have other health concerns may be advised to remain under quarantine for 14 days.  . What is the attendance policy if I get COVID? In brief, I must provide make-up course work including content and assignments when students have excused absences which include (but are not limited to) being in quarantine or isolation, religious holidays, medical conditions related to pregnancy, and military duty. However, recorded classes and hybrid/online options are not required and should not be expected. All excused absences must have documentation. See syllabus for further attendance policies. How will the Dr. Ballard know if I am absent due to quarantine or isolation? COVID-19 related absences must be document through the Student Ombudsman.  Students who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or have been exposed and require quarantining should complete the COVID-19 Student Report Form and instructors should request this form in order to excuse the absence.  . Can I inquire about classmates condition with COVID? Sadly, not with me. These are health issues and the information is protected by state and federal law. If an individual student has questions about whether they should quarantine or believe that they have been in close contact, have them reach out to the COVID Phone Bank (803-576-8511). Would we ever change to go online if too many people are sick? Only in the rare instance that 30% or more of students have documented excused absences may I take the course online. This is not to be expected and very complicated according to the current policies. What if Dr. Ballard gets sick with COVID? I have been fully vaccinated and breakthrough infection symptoms most often resemble the common cold. In the event of a breakthrough infection, I will enter the self-isolation period and the course will switch modality to synchronous online temporarily. In the rare circumstance I am unable to teach remotely, a substitute instructor will take over the course. ",

    "content": "All assignments due by the deadline as posted on the course schedule. Late work is not accepted and not eligible for revision. Please plan accordingly, and complete these assignments in advance of their deadlines to ensure any unanticipated circumstances do not result in a missed assignment. User error does not qualify you for any kind of makeup or retake opportunity. Completing and submitting the assignments by the due date is the sole responsibility of you. If you fail to submit the assignment or test by the due date, then your score for that assignment will be recorded as “zero.” . You will be allowed to access the assignments an unlimited number of times until the due date/time. If you are concerned about missing a deadline, post your assignment the day before the deadline. Be Careful: The clock on your computer may be different than the clock in Teams. If the clock is different by one second, you will be locked out of the assignment. Plan accordingly. ",

I have been teaching mathematics for almost two decades and have guided nearly 1000 students from all levels through math courses. A mindset focused on growth is essential for learning mathematics. Each day is a small step forward. When we turn around at the end of the course, only then, do we see how far we have truly traveled. For more of my pedagogical philosophy and experience, take a look at the teaching page. As an extension of teaching, I take pride in mentoring researchers at any stage. For a brief introduction to my mentees see the mentoring page. In my research, I study algebraic geometry and am particularly interested in questions arising from Homological Mirror Symmetry. Much of my current work focuses on derived categories and their relation to more classical questions. My research has been partially supported by the Simons Foundation and the National Science Foundation. It has also benefited from a membership at the Institute for Advanced Study, funding from UofSC, and the Southeastern Conference. For more information about me, see my CV. For a research summary and a list of my papers, take a look at my research page. I regularly organize mathematical events, even virtual ones. For the full list of events, see the organizing page.
